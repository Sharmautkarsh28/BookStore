The Online Book Store is a Java web application using Servlets, JSP, CSS, and MySQL. Users can browse, add books to the cart, and purchase them, while admins manage books through a secure login.

To set up, create a book_store database in MySQL and import book_store.sql. Add MySQL Connector (mysql-connector-java.jar) by configuring the build path in Eclipse. Deploy the project on Apache Tomcat and access it at http://localhost:8080/OnlineBookStore.

The project includes servlets for book management, cart operations, and authentication, with JSP pages for users and admins.
